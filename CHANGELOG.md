# Changelog

## 0.2.2 (2026-08-19)

- README: dedicated Prerequisites section (DSH, Node >= 24, the agy CLI with Google's official install guide link, first-run login, subscription note), a "how it works" intro paragraph, and an honest "what it cannot do" list in both languages - onboarding now covers first-time users.
## 0.2.1 (2026-08-19)

- Cross-platform hardening (Linux / macOS / Windows):
  - binary discovery is platform-aware: agy / agy.exe / .cmd / .bat across
    PATH, ~/.local/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin,
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs, and the npm shim dir; a real executable is
    always preferred over a cmd shim
  - Windows .cmd/.bat shims spawn through cmd.exe with cross-spawn-style
    argument quoting (unit-tested)
  - tree-kill uses taskkill /T /F on Windows (Unix process groups do not
    exist there); detached sessions are POSIX-only so no console window
    flashes on Windows
  - CRLF stdout is normalized (trailing \r stripped per line)
  - the MCP bridge script path resolves via fileURLToPath (URL.pathname
    would yield /C:/... on Windows and break the spawn)
- 5 new cross-platform tests (56 total).

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-19)

- Multimodal (path-based): DSH image attachments are staged to a local media
  directory (config `mediaDir`, TTL sweep `mediaTtlMs`, caps `mediaMaxBytes` /
  `mediaMaxImages`) and referenced by absolute path in the agy prompt with
  `--add-dir` - agy views them with its own tools. Env: `DSH_AGY_MEDIA_DIR`,
  `DSH_AGY_MEDIA_TTL_MS`.
- `agy_ask` gains `readPaths` (inline text files into the one-shot prompt;
  binaries skipped with a note) and `schema` (JSON Schema enforced via
  `--json-schema`).
- MCP reverse bridge (experimental, `mcpBridge: true` / `DSH_AGY_MCP_BRIDGE=1`):
  agy can call DSH-side tools through a loopback, token-guarded endpoint plus a
  zero-dep stdio MCP server merged into the workspace `.mcp.json`.
  `mcpToolAllowlist` restricts the exposed set; `run_code` / `agy_ask` are
  never bridged.
- Abort semantics locked by a regression test: everything the model produced
  before the caller hits stop is preserved (open block closed, then failure
  finish).
- 12 new tests (51 total).

## 0.1.5 (2026-08-19)

- README restructured into a single bilingual page: Chinese first, then
  English (README.zh.md removed; package files list updated).
- Releases now publish to npm automatically (NPM_TOKEN secret configured).
